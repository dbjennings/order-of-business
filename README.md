# order-of-business

A cleaner version of OoB starting from the ground up

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The app should be able to do the following:

- User account creation
- Create tasks for a to-do list
- Create projects to organize tasks
- Create sub-projects for further organization
- Allow users to "check off" items on any list
